# JSP_project

Web application allowing management of tickets purchases for the bus transport company named “CBBus”. 
Project was based on a previously made PHP project (https://github.com/juliamarcinkowska/PHP_project), but it has less functionalities, since there are only two types of users – administrator and client.  

Project was co-created with Julia Marcinkowska (https://github.com/juliamarcinkowska).
